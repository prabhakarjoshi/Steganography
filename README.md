**Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or a physical object.**

This project consists of two types of steganographies , Text Steganography and Image Steganography.
It provides a CLI to execute commands and encode or decode as per our requirements.

2) Provides a specific key for text steganography which is required during decoding. Without the key,message cannot be extracted.
